MILITARY MEDICAL REPORT - Myint Aung
Date: July 15, 2025
Patient Name: Myint Aung
Age: 23

Subjective Complaints: Patient presented with a severe, persistent cough and complained of difficulty breathing. He had several episodes of what appeared to be uncontrollable coughing fits during the examination. He stated that he has a chronic respiratory condition.

Objective Findings:
- Lungs: Auscultation revealed clear lung sounds with no adventitious sounds (wheezes, rales, or rhonchi).
- Vital Signs: Respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, heart rate 78 bpm, blood pressure 120/75 mmHg. Oxygen saturation 99%.
- Physical Appearance: Patient appeared in no acute distress when not actively coughing.

Professional Assessment: The severity of the patient's reported symptoms, particularly the dramatic coughing fits, is inconsistent with the objective physical examination findings. The lack of any significant lung pathology suggests the symptoms were likely simulated. Suspect malingering to avoid conscription.
